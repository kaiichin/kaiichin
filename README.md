# Hi there! I'm Izhar 👋 

I am a Computer Science student from **BINUS University** 🇮🇩 currently on an exchange program at **Saxion University of Applied Sciences** 🇳🇱, where I am studying Creative Media and Game Technologies (CMGT).

I am currently exploring different specializations within the industry and haven't settled on one specific path yet. I enjoy playing video games (Valorant, Sleeping Dogs, and Football Manager) and I am a big football fan, especially supporting Manchester United.

I am currently still searching for my career specializations and haven't settled on any path yet, i am also a Game Enthusiast and a Football Fan.
